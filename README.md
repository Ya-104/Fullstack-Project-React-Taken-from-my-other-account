#### Video Demo: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpDFoljGSl8)

#### Description:

Trend Bites is a full-stack web application built with React (TypeScript) for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. It enables users to discover, rate, and view community feedback on restaurants based on monthly trends, helping users find fresh and trending dining options.

##### Core Functionality:

-  Restaurant Ratings: Logged-in users can rate restaurants out of 5 stars, with optional comments, to highlight monthly trending spots. Ratings are aggregated to showcase popular restaurants.

-  Community Feedback: Users can view ratings and comments (if provided) from others, fostering a collaborative rating environment.

-  Monthly Reset: At the end of each month, all ratings are cleared from the database, allowing users to re-rate for the new month and keeping trends fresh.

##### User Features:

-  Authentication: Secure registration and login system, with options to update profile pictures and passwords.

-  Profile Dashboard: Displays personal rating history across all months, including voted restaurants, past trends, and any comments provided by the user.

-  Themes: Toggle between light and dark modes for a personalized experience.

Unlike Google Maps, Trend Bites focuses on dynamic, monthly trends, enabling small restaurants to rise quickly in popularity and helping users discover new dining experiences. This project showcases full-stack development, user authentication, database management, and responsive UI design, creating an engaging, community-driven platform for restaurant ratings.
